## Who produces the AV Artifact Atlas?

We do! AVAA is a community resource. It was started by the [Stanford Media Preservation Lab](https://lib.stanford.edu/stanford-media-preservation-lab/) and [New York University](http://dlib.nyu.edu/dlts/), using examples of artifacts gathered in their digitization work. The [Bay Area Video Coalition](http://www.bavc.org) led a project in 2013-2014 to enhance the Atlas. BAVC also hosts the site and provides back-end support with the services of [Hellar Studios, LLC](http://hellarstudios.com).

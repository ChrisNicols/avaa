# This will have to be updated!

## Ways to update a page:


### Using Github

- Click on link at the bottom of an artifact page
- Log in (if not already logged in)
- Click on edit file button (pencil icon above text)
- Preview results
- File out the "Commit Changes" box at the bottom of the page and choose "create a new branch and start a pull request"

Note that {% raw %} {{ site.baseurl }} {% endraw %} must be appended to the beginning of links and images. Images will not show up in the Github markdown page but will work on the website. This is also true for Prose.io.

### Using Prose.io

- Click on link at the bottom of an artifact page
- Log into Prose using Github credentials (if not already logged in)
- Edit page and preview results
- Click the Save button (last button on right navigational bar) and submit your change request

### Adding Video

In AVAA, videos are embedded. We recommend first uploading video examples that are less than 1 minute in length to the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/). Videos should be placed under the "Examples" section of the artifact page and include a brief description of the original format and source. Sizes should conform to a width of 560 pixels and a height of 315 pixels. 

The sample syntax below embeds video in both Prose and GitHub. Replace only the URLs and the description.

### Using Github Issues

- Click on link at the bottom of an artifact page

- Fill out the form with the kind of change you would like to see made

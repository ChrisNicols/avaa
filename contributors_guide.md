# This will have to be updated!

## Ways to update a page:


### Using Github

- Click on link at the bottom of an artifact page
- Log in (if not already logged in)
- Click on edit file button (pencil icon above text)
- Preview results
- File out the "Commit Changes" box at the bottom of the page and choose "create a new branch and start a pull request"

Note that {% raw %} {{ site.baseurl }} {% endraw %} must be appended to the beginning of links and images. Images will not show up in the Github markdown page but will work on the website.

### Using Prose.io

- Click on link at the bottom of an artifact page
- Log into Prose using Github credentials (if not already logged in)
- Edit page and preview results
- Click the Save button (last button on right navigational bar) and submit your change request

### Using Github Issues

- Click on link at the bottom of an artifact page
- Click on "New Issue" in the top right
- Fill out the form with the kind of change you would like to see made

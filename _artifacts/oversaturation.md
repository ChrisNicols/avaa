Oversaturation refers to high chrominance amplitude in a video signal, creating the appearance of very intense color in the image. Depending on severity of oversaturation, color in the image may appear to bleed into areas outside of an objectâ€™s apparent boundaries. Most [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTSC NTSC] broadcast standards require that the composite video signal not exceed 120 [IRE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRE_(unit)) (flat). SMPTE split field color bars use 75% saturation as the maximum value for calibration, although there are other patterns used for testing which contain 100% saturation values.

## Can it be fixed? 

Yes, oversaturation is correctable through retransfer and adjustment of the VTR output using a  processing amplifier to lower the chroma levels.

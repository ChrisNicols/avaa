We are considering black frames that have been generated during the digitisation process, not black frames that have been added in case of a bad film tear during printing (a method used for fixing an image negative, in order that it remains in sync with the sound negative).

## Can it be fixed?

If the black frame in the file replaces an actual frame of the film, then no. The black frame can be removed, but the missing frame needs to be re-digitised, othervise the file is not complete.

When the black frame is added in the file to the actual frames, then yes, it can be removed.

## Example(s)

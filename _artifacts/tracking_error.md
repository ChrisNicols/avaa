Tracking error is visible as a distortion produced during playback caused by the inability of video heads to correctly follow the video tracks recorded on a tape. The tracking control adjustment corrects for this error. It delays the control track signal during playback so its position approximates the position of the control track head that was used on the recording machine.

## Can it be fixed?

Yes, a tracking error can be corrected by careful tracking adjustment.

Severe tracking issues with a particular piece of media may require a custom tape path alignment.


## Quality Control Tools 
Large tracking errors in a video file will be clearly evident as significant spikes in the Temporal Outliers (TOUT) graph. Example below.

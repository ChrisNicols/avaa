Print-through is the magnetic phenomena that occurs when a tape signal is imprinted on to the adjacent layer of tape during storage. During playback it is heard as either pre or post-echo, and it is more noticeable at high recorded signal levels. When tapes are stored "heads out" (oxide in), a faint echo will be heard before the main signal during playback. When tapes are stored "tails out" (oxide out), a post-echo will be heard after the main signal during playback. The post-echo is less obvious than the pre-echo, which is one of the reasons tapes should be stored tails out.  

Pre-echo is also a problem in disc recordings where the groove might modulate so much as to affect its neighboring instance.

## Can it be fixed?

There are two common fixes for print-through:

* Rewind the tape, at least three times, prior to playback.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>
* If you have a tape machine that can apply low level bias, engaging it can help mitigate print-through, “though it may also have an effect [on] the signal, especially if over-applied, and should only be used as a last resort and then every carefully.”<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>

## Description

Audio dropout is a brief reduction or loss of signal that occurs during playback, and it can be found in both analog and digital audio tape sources. Read about digital dropout [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/artifacts/digital_audio_dropout.html). Dropout is the result of a defect in the carrier or playback mechanism. Analog audio dropout is caused by anything that diminishes the uniformity of the magnetic media, such as dust, tape damage, or a defect in the tape stock.

## Can it be fixed?

Dropouts can often be reduced, but they can be difficult to eliminate during playback. If you get a recording with dropout, your best bet is to clean the playback heads and re-digitize. Should dropouts persist, production or access copies of files can be remediated using software tools (for example, [Izotope Spectral Repair](http://help.izotope.com/docs/rx/pages/userguide_spectralrepair.htm)), that use digital signal processing (DSP) techniques to resynthesize gaps in audio content.

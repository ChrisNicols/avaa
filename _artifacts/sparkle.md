Sparkle refers to small white spots on the image, usually due to tiny pieces of dust or dirt being present on the film negative (or internegative). Sparkle often occurs more frequently at the beginning or end of a reel of film.

## Can it be fixed?

Sparkle can be reduced by cleaning film using an ultrasonic cleaner, particle transfer rollers, or even hand-cleaning with a velvet. Rewashing the film will also help reduce sparkle.

If the sparkle is printed-in, its appearance can be reduced or removed by using digital restoration software.

## Example(s)

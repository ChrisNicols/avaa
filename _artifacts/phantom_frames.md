A phantom frame is a very dark frame. You can hardly recognise more than the perforation, when an overscan is done. This happens when the light flash is not properly synchronised with reading the sensor's data.

It may depend on the OS and its configuration (switching off all the "nice" graphic features you don't use often helps).

## Can it be fixed?

Once it's in the file, usually not.

## Example(s)

[wanted!]

Missing frames often occur when the triggering of the camera is not correctly timed.

## Can it be fixed?

No, if the frame is missing in the file, then only re-digitising that frame (or that section of the film) would allow to complete the file.

## Example(s)

Two errors in the same clip: missing frame followed by duplicated frame:
